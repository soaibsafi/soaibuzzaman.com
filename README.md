I didn't build this website as a theme or template, but for my own purpose. Feel free to use whatever you want to use from it. If you need any support or guidance feel free to contact me. Moreover, I recommend using [Gridsome Starter](https://gridsome.org/starters/) to set up your personal portfolio.
