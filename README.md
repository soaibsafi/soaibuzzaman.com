I didn't build this website as a theme or template, but for my own purpose. Feel free to use whatever you want to use from it, but I didn't have any intension fo being cloned or deployed. Though if you need any support or guidance feel free to contact me. Moreover, I recommend using [Gridsome Starter](https://gridsome.org/starters/) to set up your personal portfolio.
